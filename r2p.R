# this is R script to analyze EDX data of GBS. 

# start with a long format which contains raw NCS data of an individual. 
# convert the raw values into the percentage values relative to upper/lower limits of normal values. 
# need the reference values. 
# need the formula to calculate height-adjusted F-wave latency values. 

# i will later develop a script for interpretation based on several published criteria, 
# and also graphic representations.
